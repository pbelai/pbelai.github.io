I am currently working as an Application Developer for Zurich Insurance. I have a master's degree in Information Systems from [Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies](https://www.fiit.stuba.sk/en.html?page_id=749).

My language of preference is R, but I also had my fair share of Java and Scala.
