[{"categories":["R"],"content":"It is always interesting to go back to your older projects. You can spot, how is your coding style evolving, and how you, as a programmer, are improving. Recently, I had to go through the code of one of my first projects in R and boy, was it a mess. It was supposed to download Financial Statements of all the businesses in Slovakia for a certain year. It worked, barely. But trying to understand the code was a pain. No functions, random variable names, no documentation… There was even a public API, but for some reason (and I am sure, that at a time It was a “great” one), I have decided not to use it but to scrape web pages directly. So I have decided this is a great opportunity to see, how would I do things now, and finally do this code some justice and banish this abomination that I have once called code. Public API First of all, we have to take a look at a public API endpoints and data model. Its full documentation can be found here. From the data model, we are interested in accounting entities and financial statements. It is also possible to see an expected output from the endpoints, which we will use for preparing our database tables. Project structure This time, things should be done right, that’s why I have decided to create an R package. This is a first step, that will give this project an initial structure. This also gives developer bigger control over which packages are used, which functions we want to export, and a lot more. All these great features come at almost no cost, so there is no reason not to create an R package. If you haven’t created an R package before, Hadley has a great tutorial on how to do things right. In the previous project, data were saved as .csv files which were the manually concated. Now we want to have downloaded data stored reasonably. Because of the relational nature of the data, we will use the PostgreSQL database. Preparing database After you install your PostgreSQL database, we need to create tables, where we will store our data. All the tables can be created with the following script: CREATE TABLE financial_report_for_financial_statement ( id serial PRIMARY KEY, id_financial_statement VARCHAR (10), id_financial_report VARCHAR (10) ); CREATE TABLE financial_report_title ( id serial PRIMARY KEY, id_financial_report VARCHAR (10), nazovUctovnejJednotky VARCHAR (500), ico VARCHAR (8), dic VARCHAR (10), adresa VARCHAR (500), skNace VARCHAR (100), typZavierky VARCHAR (30), obdobieOd DATE, obdobieDo DATE, predchadzajuceObdobieOd DATE, predchadzajuceObdobieDo DATE, datumSchvalenia DATE, datumZostavenia DATE, oznacenieObchodnehoRegistra VARCHAR (100), type VARCHAR (3) ); CREATE TABLE financial_report_base ( id serial PRIMARY KEY, id_financial_report VARCHAR (10), pristupnostDat VARCHAR (20), datumPoslednejUpravy DATE, zdrojDat VARCHAR(20), kodDanovehoUradu VARCHAR(20), idSablony VARCHAR(20) ); DO language 'plpgsql' $$ DECLARE mujAkt text := 'CREATE TABLE financial_report_assets_muj(id serial PRIMARY KEY, id_financial_report varchar(10),' || string_agg('V' || i::text || ' integer', ',') || ');' FROM generate_series(1,46) As i; DECLARE mujPas text := 'CREATE TABLE financial_report_lae_muj(id serial PRIMARY KEY, id_financial_report varchar(10),' || string_agg('V' || i::text || ' integer', ',') || ');' FROM generate_series(1,44) As i; DECLARE mujZS text := 'CREATE TABLE financial_report_is_muj(id serial PRIMARY KEY, id_financial_report varchar(10),' || string_agg('V' || i::text || ' integer', ',') || ');' FROM generate_series(1,76) As i; DECLARE podAkt text := 'CREATE TABLE financial_report_assets_pod(id serial PRIMARY KEY, id_financial_report varchar(10),' || string_agg('V' || i::text || ' integer', ',') || ');' FROM generate_series(1,312) As i; DECLARE podPas text := 'CREATE TABLE financial_report_lae_pod(id serial PRIMARY KEY, id_financial_report varchar(10),' || string_agg('V' || i::text || ' integer', ',') || ');' FROM generate_series(1,134) As i; DECLARE podZS text := 'CREATE TABLE financial_repor","date":"2020-06-07","objectID":"/2020-06-07-scraping-financial-statements-of-slovak-financial-entities/:0:0","tags":["R"],"title":"Scraping financial statements of Slovak financial entities","uri":"/2020-06-07-scraping-financial-statements-of-slovak-financial-entities/"}]
